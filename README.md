# ğŸ”  Sentence Analyzer - JavaScript Challenge

This project is a simple JavaScript-based sentence analyzer developed as part of a learning checkpoint.

## ğŸ“Œ Task Objectives

The goal of this task is to write an algorithm that reads a sentence (ending with a period) character by character and determines:

- ğŸ§® The **total number of characters** in the sentence.
- ğŸ§¾ The **number of words**, assuming they are separated by single spaces.
- ğŸ”¤ The **number of vowels** in the sentence.

## ğŸ§  Implementation Details

- Each character is processed **individually** using a loop.
- **Three counter variables** are used to track characters, words, and vowels.
- The sentence must **end with a period (`.`)**.
- Input is expected from the user using prompt or standard input.
